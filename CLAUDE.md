# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Basic Rules

- All files you've modified should be committed to git with a descriptive message at the end of each step. The branch name should be claude.
- Complex requests should be broken down into smaller tasks.
- Thinkable requests should be preprocessed using gemini(e.g. gemini -p {prompt}).
- Manage strategies using the `STRATEGY.md` file.
